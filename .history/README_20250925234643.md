We have constructed RadiSim, a radiology-specific dataset with 10.6M multi- source image-text pairs. Using RadiSim, RadiSimCLIP achieves SOTA accuracy on 15/16 tasks via hierarchical validation:
-1. anatomical recognition via zero-shot classification
-2. pixel-level understanding through zero-shot detection
-3. semantic alignment via cross-modal retrieval.
This demonstrates general-purpose AI‚Äôs potential for specialized medical imaging.

The data distribution of the RadiSim dataset and its partial data processing workflow are shown below.

### Abstract

Medical vision-language models (MVLMs) have shown significant promise in medical diagnosis. However, most existing approaches are constrained by limited modality coverage and often rely on datasets lacking real-world radiological diversity and semantic precision. Moreover, current models exhibit insufficient evaluation on fine-grained tasks. In this paper, we introduce RadiSim, a large-scale Radiology dataset comprising 10.6 million image-text pairs from CT, MRI, and DR modalities, designed to Simulate the learning resources during radiologist training. Building on RadiSim, we propose RadiSimCLIP, a radiology-specific MVLM pretrained using a CLIP-style contrastive framework. The model progressively acquires multilevel capabilities‚Äîranging from anatomical recognition and pixel-level interpretability to vision-language alignment‚Äîmirroring how radiologists gain expertise. To systematically evaluate generalizability, we further propose a three-part evaluation framework: (1) zero-shot classification, which includes a novel extension to 3D volumetric data, evaluating anatomical, modality, and disease recognition; (2) zero-shot organ detection, which evaluates pixel-level semantic localization without parameter tuning; and (3) cross-modal retrieval, measuring alignment between visual features and clinical text. RadiSimCLIP achieves state-of-the-art results on 15 of 16 down-stream benchmarks. This work underscores the feasibility and potential of large-scale radiology-specific MVLMs for robust, zero-shot 3D medical understanding, representing a practical step toward clinically applicable foundation models.

### üöÄ Training and Evaluation

Training:

```bash
python src/train.py \
  --config configs/base.yaml \
  --data_root data/ \
  --output_dir outputs/run_001
```

Evaluation:

```bash
python src/eval.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/run_001/ckpt_best.pt \
  --data_root data/
```

Distributed training (optional):

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 src/train.py --config configs/base.yaml
```

Zero-shot evaluation includes: (1) classification (anatomy, modality, disease; with a 3D volumetric extension), (2) organ detection via pixel-level localization without finetuning, and (3) cross-modal retrieval.
